Markdown# Learning systemd and systemctl on Linux

The commands you're running (like `systemctl` for starting, stopping, enabling, or restarting services such as dnscrypt-proxy) are part of **systemd**, the modern system and service manager used by almost all major Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS/RHEL derivatives, openSUSE, Arch, etc.).

Learning about **systemd** and tools like `systemctl`, `journalctl` (for logs), unit files, targets, etc., is **extremely important** for any serious Linux user or admin — especially when dealing with servers, security tools (like dnscrypt), web servers, databases, or custom daemons. These are core to managing how your system boots, runs background processes, and handles dependencies.

## Best Places to Learn systemd

### 1. Quick & Practical Starting Points (Highly Recommended for Hands-On Learning)

- **DigitalOcean Tutorial: "How To Use systemctl to Manage Systemd Services and Units"**  
  URL: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units  
  This is one of the clearest, most up-to-date beginner-to-intermediate guides. It covers exactly the commands you use (`systemctl start`, `enable`, `status`, `restart`, `stop`, `mask`, etc.), with real examples. Read this first — it'll click very quickly.

- **Arch Linux Wiki: systemd page**  
  URL: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd  
  Even if you're not on Arch, this is widely regarded as the single best community resource for systemd. It's comprehensive, accurate, well-organized, and frequently updated. Start with the "Basic systemctl usage" section, then read about unit files, targets, and journalctl.

- **Red Hat / Fedora Documentation**  
  URL: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/understanding-and-administering-systemd/  
  Very practical, with cheat sheets comparing old SysVinit commands to systemd ones.

### 2. Official & Authoritative Sources (Deeper Understanding)

- **The systemd project website** (maintained by Lennart Poettering, the creator)  
  URL: https://systemd.io/  
  This is the "home" of systemd. Read the intro, then dive into the man pages linked there (especially `man systemctl`, `man systemd.unit`, `man systemd.service`).

- **Man pages on your own system** (best for reference once you're comfortable)  
  Run these directly in your terminal — they're always installed:  
  ```bash
  man systemctl          # core commands
  man systemd            # overview
  man systemd.service    # how .service files work (important for dnscrypt)
  man systemd.unit       # general unit concepts
  man journalctl         # viewing logs (very useful when troubleshooting dnscrypt)
Pro tip: Use / to search inside man pages (e.g., search for "enable").

Freedesktop.org man pages online (if you want to read without being on Linux)
URL: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.html (and linked pages)

3. Structured Learning Paths / Courses (If You Want Video or Guided Lessons)

LearnLinuxTV YouTube channel — Search for "systemd" or watch their "Systemd Explained" style videos. Very clear, practical demos.
YouTube: "Systemd Explained: How to Manage Linux Services Easily" (from various creators) — many 20–40 min videos cover exactly this.
Books: "Linux System Administrator Street Smarts" or "How Linux Works" (2nd ed. by Brian Ward) have good systemd chapters.

Suggested Learning Order

Read the DigitalOcean tutorial (30–45 min) — do the examples on your machine.
Go to the Arch Wiki systemd page and read the first few sections.
Practice commands:Bashsystemctl list-units --type=service          # see all services
systemctl status dnscrypt-proxy              # or whatever your service is named
journalctl -u dnscrypt-proxy -e              # see recent logs
When ready, read about creating/editing unit files (in /etc/systemd/system/) — that's where custom tweaks for dnscrypt often live.
Bookmark man systemctl for daily use.

Once you understand systemd basics, almost every service installation guide (including dnscrypt) becomes much easier — you'll see systemctl enable --now dnscrypt-proxy and know exactly what it does.
If you tell me your distro (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS), I can point to distro-specific extras. Keep practicing on a non-critical machine — breaking and fixing services is the fastest way to learn!
